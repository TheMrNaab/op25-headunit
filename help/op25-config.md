# Configuring OP25 Files for Use

## Getting Started

Before using OP25, you must configure several key files. The best place to begin is **Radio Reference** (radioreference.com), as it provides the most accurate and up-to-date system information. **Note:** OP25 only supports **P25 Systems**.

If you are a **Pro User** on Radio Reference, you can download talkgroup data, which can be easily converted into `_blist.csv`.

## Required Files and Their Purposes

### 1. `_trunk.tsv`

This file defines the trunking system(s) OP25 will monitor. It includes information about the system control channels and site details. **This project only supports one system currently.**

#### Example Format:

```
Sysname    Control Channel List    Offset    NAC    Modulation    TGID Tags File    Whitelist File    Blacklist File
ExampleP25    853.6375,853.9000    25000    0x1F2    cqpsk    _tgroups.csv    _whitelist.tsv    _blist.csv
```

- **Sysname:** Custom system name for reference
- **Control Channel List:** Frequencies used for trunking control
- **Offset:** Typically **25000** for P25 Phase 2 systems
- **NAC:** Network Access Code, usually found on Radio Reference
- **Modulation:** Typically **cqpsk**
- **TGID Tags File:** Points to `_tgroups.csv`
- **Whitelist/Blacklist Files:** Define which talkgroups are allowed or blocked

### 2. `_whitelist.tsv`
This file is used by the script to specify and track talkgroups that OP25 will allow. If a whitelist is used, **only** the specified talkgroup will be monitored. **Do not manually edit this file**, as the script will overwrite any changes, including the listed talkgroup numbers.

#### Example Format:
```
TGID  
12345  
```

- **TGID:** Single talkgroup ID to be monitored  

#### Example Format:
```
TGID  
12345  
67890  
13579  
```

#### Example Format:

```
TGID
12345
```

- **TGID:** Single talkgroup ID to be monitored

#### Example Format:

```
TGID
12345
67890
13579
```

- **TGID:** Talkgroup ID numbers found on Radio Reference

### 3. `_tgroups.csv`

This file assigns names to talkgroup IDs for easier identification.

#### Example Format:

```
TGID,AlphaTag,Description
12345,Dispatch,Main Dispatch Channel
67890,Ops1,Operations Channel 1
13579,EMS,Emergency Medical Services
```

- **TGID:** Talkgroup ID
- **AlphaTag:** Short name for the talkgroup
- **Description:** Brief explanation of the talkgroupâ€™s purpose

### 4. `_blist.tsv`
This file lists all talkgroups that should be **blocked** from being monitored. Its primary function is to track channels and groups for the software. Copy this file from the `templates` directory into the OP25 installation directory. **Do not edit this file manually**, as the script will overwrite any changes, including the listed talkgroup numbers.

#### Example Format:

```
TGID
24680
```

- **TGID:** Single talkgroup ID to be ignored

#### Example Format:

```
TGID
24680
13579
98765
```

- **TGID:** Talkgroup IDs to be ignored

### Additional Notes

- If **no whitelist or blacklist** is specified, OP25 will **monitor all talkgroups**.
- If using **Radio Reference Pro**, download talkgroup data as CSV, modify as needed, and rename it as `_blist.csv` or `_tgroups.csv`.
- After setting up the files, launch OP25 with the correct trunking system parameters.

## Final Steps

Once files are configured, you will move onto `system.json` file for your system's configuration.
